## Change variables (start with $)

[$WEBCAM]
name = $CAMNAME
uri  = http://$QW-ADDRESS/snapshot.jpg
user = $USER
pass = $PASS
imgd = /tmp    # change to your image dir
camd = %(imgd)s/%(name)s
log  = %(camd)s/kwlatest.log

## You can easily add another WEBCAM
# [$WEBCAM2]
# name = $CAMNAME2
# uri = http://$QW-ADDRESS-2/snapshot.jpg
# user = $USER2
# pass = $PASS2
# imgd = /tmp    # change to your image dir
# camd = %(imgd)s/%(name)s
# log  = %(camd)s/kwlatest.log
